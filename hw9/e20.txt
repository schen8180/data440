Dear Sophia,

Per the announcement from Dean Zeman about extending the P/F policy to all students for the Fall of 2020, the Office of Academic Advising is holding virtual walk-in hours this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon to answer questions. Please come with any questions about the policy or how its implications. To protect your privacy, any specific questions involving your classes should be addressed in a one-on-one meeting with an academic advisor. You can schedule an appointment here.

Below is the language from Dean Zeman’s email on 8/26/2020:

Based on the decision of the Arts & Sciences faculty-led Educational Policy Committee, for the fall 2020 semester only:

·         All​ undergraduates will be allowed to take one A&S elective class on a P/F basis. Typically, only Juniors or Seniors can take a class P/F.

·         You cannot use P/F for a class required for your major, minor, proficiency, or COLL requirements.

·         Changes to P/F grading mode must be made in Banner by the last day of class: Friday November 13th

Freshmen and sophomores should consult with their pre-major advisor on a class that they wish to take P/F.  If you have not yet declared your major/minor and you end up taking a class P/F that would go towards your major/minor requirements, you can at a later date petition the Committee on Degrees for an exception to this rule. Prospective business majors should not take BBA prerequisite courses pass/fail.
