Details
Through this program, students will assist Blayton Building with gardening and general beautification projects of the property. No previous gardening experience is required. Though students will not interact with residents directly, their work is invaluable to improving the quality of life for residents and supporting the Williamsburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority.

The Blayton Building is a 6-10 minute walk or 2-5 minute bike ride from campus, and volunteers will be working together most Mondays from 1:30-2:30 starting September 21.
