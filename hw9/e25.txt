JOBS, INTERNSHIPS, AND MORE UPDATES
Workforce Recruitment Program:

The Workforce Recruitment Program for College Students with Disabilities (WRP) is a recruitment and referral program that connects Federal Government and select private-sector employers nationwide with highly motivated postsecondary students and recent graduates with disabilities who are eager to demonstrate their abilities in the workplace through paid summer internships or permanent jobs.

Learn more at their virtual information session, Wednesday, September 16 at 6:00pm.



 

Parker Dewey Micro-Internships:

Looking to gain some experience this year?  Check out the Micro-Internship opportunities at Parker Dewey.  Micro-Internships are short-term, paid, professional assignments that are similar to those given to new hires or interns. These projects enable students to demonstrate skills, explore career paths, and build their networks as they seek a full-time role. Unlike traditional internships, Micro-Internships can take place year-round, typically range from 5 to 40 hours of work, and are due between one week and one month after kick-off. Micro-Internships are used by companies ranging from those in the Fortune 100 to emerging start-ups, and go across departments including sales, marketing, technology, HR, and finance. 



 

On-Campus Opportunities:

TutorZone is currently accepting applications. Please apply by September 15. They will continue to accept applications throughout the semester, however after September 15, your application may not be reviewed until 2021. For more details, visit their website: wm.edu/tutors.


 

COHEN INDUSTRY SNEAK PEEK: STEM CAREERS

Here's a quick preview of what to expect in the STEM newsletter. This email is delivered every week and features information about upcoming STEM careers events and opportunities, as well as a Tip of the Week. If this interests you, be sure to update your Industry newsletter preferences in TribeCareers under Account > Academic.

 
CAREER READINESS TIPS OF THE WEEK
Each week we'll take a deeper look at one of the NACE Career Competencies helping to identify your familiarity with the competency while also providing options for developing or sharing your abilities. Visit our webpage on the NACE Career Competencies for more information.

Digital Technology 

Digital Technology is a competency that is constantly developing. This week, we have multiple ways you can add to your level of fluency in preparation for and participation in the upcoming Virtual Career Fairs:

In addition to the Virtual Career Fair Tour video shared under Upcoming Events in this email, you can visit the Resources section of TribeCareers.wm.edu to review the instructions for preparing your profile and setting up your 1:1 video chats with the recruiters. You can also find a full list of resources and tips for the fairs on wm.edu/career/tribrcareers/fall-2020-update.
For the Virtual Career Fair, recruiters will be using their preferred video chat platform. These platforms have become more and more common across all industries. For the fairs, you may need to switch between platforms depending on the organization. In your future work environment, you'll likely become familiar with one as a predominant resource. To learn about some of the more common platforms, check out our Virtual Chat Platform Best Practices Guide.
If you'd like to practice introducing yourself in a video chat platform, log into Big Interview to access the behavioral interview questions, including "tell me about yourself," as a good skill builder for eye contact with the camera, tone of voice, posture, and review of your chosen background.
Digital Technology is defined as:

Leverage existing digital technologies ethically and efficiently to solve problems, complete tasks, and accomplish goals.
Demonstrates effective adaptability to new and emerging technologies.
