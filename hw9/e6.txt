Your classmate posted a new Question.

topMatches function

Before starting, make sure that you understand what the functions topMatches() and getRecommendations() in the example code do.

getRecommendations() is pretty straight forward. It returns movie recommendations for a particular user.

topMatches() appears to return other users who have similar taste in movies. Correct? The default similarity formula used is the Pearson correlation coefficient. Pearson should range from -1.0 to 1.0 but some results had a value slightly greater than 1.0. Is this just a rounding issue?

print(topMatches(preferences, '777', n=5))
[(1.0000000000000018, '182'), (1.0000000000000002, '575'), (1.0, '909'), (1.0, '898'), (1.0, '861')]
