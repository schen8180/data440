Hello!

This week, we published a feature about how Apple’s latest iPhone was made not just in China, but also in India — the first time ever for a flagship iPhone. Rest of World reporters Viola Zhou and Nilesh Christopher take us behind the scenes in Sunguvarchatram, the site of Foxconn’s plant in India, and the successes and struggles that have played out on one of the world’s most consequential factory floors.

Labor issues and political uncertainty in China have Foxconn, Apple’s biggest manufacturer, looking to assemble its products elsewhere. To prepare its new Indian factory for the launch of the iPhone 15, Foxconn flew in hundreds of Chinese engineers to train the next generation of builders. But assembly line workers, technicians, and managers alike describe unexpected culture clashes at their new factory. One Chinese worker said: “People from China might talk in a blunt way. But when we talk with Indians, we should be more polite.”

In China, Foxconn demands long days, high targets, and minimal delays and mistakes — all of which proved difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in India. Still, a successful production run of the new iPhone would show India’s budding manufacturing prowess, and that a globalized supply chain is possible. The question loomed for months over the factory: Would they be able to hit their targets?
