Hi All, 

I've received a few questions via email, so I thought I should check in with you all again via email/Bb announcement. There was a lot of movement happening with add/drop last week, so if you're new to the class or are still getting used to remote learning again I understand!

Make sure to watch my introduction Panopto video if you haven't already. Jenna, your teaching assistant, has also filmed an introduction video that is under the syllabus tab. The Panopto videos are the way I'll be delivering all of my lectures. They can all be found under the Panopto Videos tab or in the specific week/chapter tabs. Since this course is asynchronous you do not need to view them on a particular day, but I will try and post them at least by the Monday or Tuesday of the week that that content area is listed on the syllabus. 

The SONA research pool is now open, so I believe you should have received an email from them with login information. If you did not and you wish to participate in research to fulfill the course research requirement please email the SONA coordinators. Their information can be found in the document under the SONA Research Information tab. 

Remember you'll need to complete the first exam between 5pm Sept. 14 - 5pm Sept. 15. I'll give you all more information about the exam early next week. It will cover chapters 1, 2, & 11. 

Jenna and I are also working on the first participation opportunity. We will give you all more details about that soon. Remember you'll only need to complete 4 of them throughout the semester. I'm planning on offering around 8 different opportunities over the course of the semester. 

Let me know if you have any questions! I believe I'm all caught up on emails, so if you emailed me this week and I haven't responded please feel free to send me another message. :) 

Best,

Dr. Moloney
