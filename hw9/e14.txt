Your classmate posted a new Question.

Mr. Hi vs John Split

Maybe this is obvious but for part one of HW5 how do we know how to split the nodes between Mr. Hi and John? Is it based on the degrees (i.e. Mr. Hi has nodes with high degree side with him and John has those with low degree)? Or do we simply do a random split down the middle? Just unsure how to recognize what nodes belong to what factions (Mr.Hi or John).
