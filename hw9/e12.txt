Q4 - Extra Credit

1) Use D3.js's force-directed graph layout to draw the Karate Club Graph before the split.

2) Color the nodes according to the factions they belong to (John A or Mr. Hi).

# 1 and 2 above aren't that difficult. d3 example at Observable shows how it can be done.

3) After a button is clicked, split the graph based on the original graph split.

I can show the connected graph on an HTML page, and show a button on that invokes a .js file but have been unable to have the .js file display the disconnected graph on the initial HTML page. 

I can use the .js file to link to another HTML page where the disconnected graph will be displayed but I don't think that's what really being asked for.
