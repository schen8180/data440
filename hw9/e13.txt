nan values for the scatterplot in Part 3 11/7/2023, 1:37:18 PM

Hi, I just have a simple question of Part 3.

For the range of x and y, I tried super big and super small ones and found the maximum and minimum values of x and y. However, there is still a weird point in the upper-left corner of the scatterplot when starting animate it, do I need to drop the nan value variables?

Thanks!

Part 3 axis labels 11/7/2023, 1:33:39 PM

For the x and y-axis labels in Part 3 of the Interacting with Data project, should we err on the side of including information, or keeping the labels succinct?

For example, for the FI (food insecurity) feature, would the label "Individuals living in food-insecure households" be sufficient?

Or should I just have a long label that includes all of the information, and have it be something like: "Individuals who self-reported living in households with severe or moderate food insecurity"?

Or should the label simply be something like "Food Insecurity"?

Thanks.
