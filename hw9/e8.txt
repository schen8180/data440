Minasan,

Are you interested in working in Japan after graduation? 

One attractive option is the JET (Japan Exchange & Teaching) Program, which is managed by the Japanese government and brings young professionals to Japan to teach English in public and private schools.  Many of our students have participated in this competitive program over the years.  This year's application deadline is November 17.  If you'd like to know more about the JET experience, please join us for a Zoom roundtable discussion with several W&M alums who are currently in Japan working for JET or have recently completed their time with the program.
